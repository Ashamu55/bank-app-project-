        <h3>Security Tips</h3>
        <li>Giving away your Internet Banking login, card details, PIN and codes from your token device, gives anyone total access to your account. HarborTrust Bank will never ask for any of these details via any form of communication</li>
        <li>Keep your ATM cards safe and do not share your personal identity number (PIN) with anyone. Do not keep any written copy of your PIN with your card. Memorize it.</li>
        <li>Seeing a phone number or email address you recognize does not mean it is genuine. Always give cold-callers a cold reception</li>
        <li>Use your hand or body to shield your PIN when you are conducting transactions at the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or when making Point of Sale (POS) transactions at retail stores.</li>
        <li>Create strong passwords for your Internet Banking login and card details. Change them often.</li>
        <li>Check your bank account statements and card transactions regularly to make sure these only reflect transactions you have made. If you see a transaction you cannot explain, report it to the bank.</li>
        <li>Subscribe to SMS alerts to be delivered to your cell phone or email, so you can stay updated on your account activity.</li>
        <!-- <li>Always log on to our internet banking service via our website - www.gtbank.com</li> -->
        <li>Watch out for copycat websites. Don’t fall prey to any website that looks similar to HarborTrust Bank website. Check the URL carefully. (https://)</li>

        <h3>Recognizing Fraud</h3>
        <p>You are the first and best layer of defense in combating online fraud. Learning to properly detect and avoid online scams is the ultimate protection against fraud. Read the tips below to help you spot potential scams. <br><br>

            Online fraud typically takes the form of fraudulent e-mails and Web sites. These forged means of communication often use corporate logos, colors and legal disclaimers to make them appear authentic.</p>

        <h4>Fraudulent Emails</h4>
        <p>Fraudulent e-mails are the most common avenue of online scams. A "spoofed" e-mail is one that purports to be from a reputable source in an attempt to trick you into divulging personal or account information, sending payment, or otherwise taking an action that will result in fraud. These attacks are common because they are low-tech and can be easily deployed on a massive scale. Even though the warning signs are there, "phishing" and scam e-mails continue to fool people. Some of these mails also request that customers update their account records by clicking on links to fake Internet banking and Interswitch websites.</p>

        <h4>Spoofed Websites</h4>
        <p>Spoofed Web sites, like phishing e-mails, are used by fraudsters who build fake websites that look very similar to HarborTrust Bank Limited’s website to lure unsuspecting customers into submitting their online banking log-in information and card details which are later used to access such accounts. Spoof Web sites allow fraudsters to collect such sensitive information as Internet Banking Account and ATM Card Details. <br><br>

            HarborTrust Bank Limited will never ask a customer to provide, verify or update their personal, account or financial information via email or pop-up windows. This includes: Passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), or ATM, Credit or Debit Card numbers. If you receive an email requesting such information, do not respond and never click on a link contained in a suspicious email.</p>
